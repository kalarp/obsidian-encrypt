# Obsidian Encrypt

## Create Encrypted Notes Within Your [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) Vault

Obsidian Encrypt is a community plugin that lets you encrypt and decrypt your notes in Obsidian. You can choose to encrypt an entire note or just selected text within a note.

Encrypted notes are never decrypted to disk giving you peace-of-mind that the decrypted contents haven't been sync'd or backed up to external systems.

> ⚠️ WARNING - Use at your own risk ⚠️
> - Your passwords are never stored anywhere. If you forget your passwords you can't decrypt your notes.
> - No known audits have been undertaken for the soundness of encryption methods being used.  Unwanted decryption by a third party may be possible if they have access to your files.
> - Bugs could be introduced to the software at anytime. You are responsible for having backups of your notes.
