# Obsidian Encrypt

## Create Encrypted Notes Within Your [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) Vault

Obsidian Encrypt is a community plugin that lets you encrypt and decrypt your notes in Obsidian. You can choose to encrypt an entire note or just selected text within a note.

Encrypted notes are never decrypted to disk giving you peace-of-mind that the decrypted contents haven't been sync'd or backed up to external systems.

> ⚠️ WARNING - Use at Your Own Risk ⚠️
> - Your passwords are never stored. If you forget your password, your notes cannot be decrypted..
> - The encryption methods used have not been independently audited. Unauthorized access may be possible if someone gains access to your files.
> - Bugs may be introduced at any time. You are solely responsible for maintaining backups of your notes.
