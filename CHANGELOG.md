## v2.0.0

To make encrypted notes more resilient, starting from v2.0.0, the plugin introduces a new .encrypted note.

The advantages of this new approach are:

- Your note contents are always encrypted on disk.
- Encrypted bytes are hidden away from the user making it difficult to accidentally corrupt the encryption and thus making the note un-decryptable.
- Encrypted notes are easily identifiable by their '.encrypted' file extension.
- Better workflow for editing encrypted notes.
